The airport is a short drive south, and restaurants and retailers scattered across region provide ample amenities for residents and tenants alike.,Clark County has put itself on the map in recent years, especially in the city of Vancouver. Many residents have moved to the area, attracted by Washington’s lack of state income tax and the ability to buy goods in Oregon without paying sales tax. An increase in housing costs in Portland has also driven people north of the Columbia River. Vancouver is home to several notable employers, including Banfield Pet Hospital, PeaceHealth and Frito-Lay, which has helped increase buying power in the county and solidified a well-educated local population. ,The range of inventory here provides industrial users a number of options to fit their warehousing, distribution or manufacturing needs.

Known as West D-FW Airport, the industrial zone on the western side of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport is among the few places in North Texas that provides that value. It’s located in one of America's fastest-growing cities near interstates paired with unparalleled international and domestic connectivity from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. ,The airport has made a concerted effort to increase its industrial offering in the past few years. As a result, the total tonnage has grown by double digits, and new cargo carriers now serve the area. In addition to the accessibility to global markets, many of the properties and developable land fall within the airport's Foreign Trade Zone. Companies operating in this area receive numerous inventory tax exemptions for international inventory. They benefit from reduced customs duties, tariffs, and taxes, potentially saving companies millions of dollars while providing direct airport ramp access and reducing shipping times.,West D-FW Airport’s vacancy rates typically track lower than the rest of Dallas-Fort Worth Because of the numerous advantages of this location, rents are usually higher than in many other industrial nodes. However, higher rents have not slowed leasing activity, which has remained strong in West D-FW Airport throughout this economic expansion.

The majority immediately to the west and increasingly the east of the submarket, especially with the completion of the Grand Parkway. The North Hardy Toll Road also benefits from rooftop growth in Montgomery County to the north, particularly Springwoods Village, The Woodlands, and Conroe. The area draws distribution tenants looking to be close to the fastest-growing population region in Houston and in a newer stock of buildings. ,The area’s industrial inventory has grown by nearly 50% since 2010. Yet vacancies remain relatively low. Among the largest recent developments, Grocers Supply and Conn’s HomePlus moved into their build-to-suits in the area recently.
