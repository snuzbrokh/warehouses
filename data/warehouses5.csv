Baseline, developed by McWHINNEY, is the region’s new go-to destination–part dining district, part beer garden, part business hub. It stands as a new economic center for the region and a new way to live and work in Broomfield. Beneath the spectacular Front Range, directly north of downtown Denver, east of Boulder, and northwest of DIA, Baseline is the new central. At the junction of I-25, E-470 and the Northwest Parkway and, of course, Baseline Road, the location offers easy access to the heart of Boulder and the mountains beyond. And it will serve as a new gateway to Denver from all points north. Mass transit will further strengthen these connections in the near future.
