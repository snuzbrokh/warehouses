Correlation Dashboard by State:
Lease rates across the US vary with respect to different features. Being near the coastal ports fetches high rates in California and New York but has no sway in Kansas or Oklahoma. How can we see what features correlate to higher rates? I created this [dashboard](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~snuzbrokh/108#plot) to answer this question.
