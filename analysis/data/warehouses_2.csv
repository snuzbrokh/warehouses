The property was originally the headquarters of the Armitage Manufacturing Company, which produced tar paper roofing materials. The main portion of the building was built in 1900. It was designed by the Richmond firm Noland & Baskervill, now known as Baskervill, when the firm was just three years old.
The industrial building consists primarily of two wings, with the original two-story brick-constructed plant built in 1900 for the production of building supplies and roofing paper, and then used for corrugated container manufacturing. In 1954, a large barrel-roofed, metal bowstring truss wing was added to the rear corner of the warehouse.",Industrial,"153,834 SF","Lease rate does not include utilities, property expenses or building services,Can be combined with additional space(s) for up to 76,917 SF of adjacent space",,2 Spaces,VA,For Lease,Industrial,,

Historically, the tenant mix in South Pinellas has been dominated by the aerospace and defense industries, but the rise of e-commerce has fueled industrial demand in warehouses targeting last-mile deliveries servicing the local population. Competition in this niche sector is becoming fierce, with the older inventory and relatively lower ceiling heights limiting the total available space for prospective tenants. The South Pinellas industrial market is now incredibly tight, with average occupancy rates near the highest on record.,Asking rents here vary widely across property types and due to South Pinellas’ large geography.
