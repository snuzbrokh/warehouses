The original structure still in use is two stories and constructed of concrete and steel. Each floor is approx. 7,500 sq ft  (total 15k sq ft over the 2 floors) with 11’ clear height ceiling. The 2nd floor is accessed via a stairway and a large opening in the wall which pallets and the like can be moved through from the new structure adjacent to the older structure. There is an internal truck well in this structure capable of handling two trucks of various sizes with a height limitation of 11.5-12ft.
A few years ago, an older structure located on the property was demolished and a new structure was built in its place next to the older structure described above. This is a pre engineered clear span steel structure which measures 100’ x 180’ (18,000 sq ft) with a sloped roof enabling clear operating heights of 26-29 feet. There are two internal truck docks each with a dock leveler, these docks can be utilized by tractor trailers. Adjacent to the dock there is a substantial concrete ramp enabling truck access to the interior of the new building space.
Both structures have a dry type sprinkler system allowing full use of clear heights in both buildings.
There is approx. 800 sq ft of office space located on the second story of the older structure with windows overlooking the new building through a common wall shared by the two structures. This office space is currently set up as one space but is sub dividable for private offices if desired. Nearby the office there are men’s and ladies bathrooms.
