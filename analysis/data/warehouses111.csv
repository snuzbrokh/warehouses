Mountainous geography separates the region from the L.A. basin’s notorious suburban sprawl, giving it a somewhat secluded feel, and Downtown Los Angeles is an hour’s drive away on a good day. The region straddles I-5, California’s main north-south artery, giving it a desirable location for logistics operations moving goods from the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles up the West Coast to Northern California and the Pacific Northwest.,Most industrial activity is concentrated north of the Santa Clarita River in close proximity to I-5. Third-party logistics companies comprise a major portion of the tenant base, with a mix of light manufacturing operations and support services for L.A.’s massive entertainment industry.,In comparison to the rest of L.A.’s drum-tight industrial market, tenants here may find a few more availabilities. This is one of the last corners of the region with significant amounts of raw, developable land, and speculative construction is more prevalent here than almost anywhere else in the county.,Santa Clarita’s distance from the ports and heart of the metro limits the appeal for regional last-mile distribution operations. Industrial rents tend to be more affordable than in more centrally located industrial hubs. However, the area’s strategic position as the last sizable community along I-5 before departing L.A County to points north helps to underpin demand and continues to draw the attention of developers and investors.
