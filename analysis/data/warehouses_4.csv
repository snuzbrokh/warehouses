Being north of I-10 affords truck drivers the opportunity to avoid the tunnels that frequently congest I-10 in downtown Mobile.  Eastbound drivers can cross the Mobile River via the Cochrane Bridge north of downtown and connect with I-10 on the east side of the tunnels.  West bound drivers can access I-10 where I-65 terminates, again avoiding traffic caused by the tunnels.
The building is located in the Mobile River Industrial Park in Saraland, Alabama, along with several other light industrial operations.  The eastern border of the park is a state owned wilderness area and a Saraland police precinct is located at the entrance to the park on its west side, affording tenants a secure work environment.   The Mobile River Industrial Park is located on Highway 43, a vibrant retail corridor in Saraland.
Saraland is a suburb of Mobile in the northern part of Mobile County.  Saraland is a rapidly growing community due in large part to its independent, autonomous public school system.  New residential subdivisions are under construction and a Mobile-based hospital system is building a new campus at one of Saraland's two interstate interchanges.  Major retailers continue to open stores in Saraland.
