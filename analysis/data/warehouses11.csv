Located roughly 20 minutes outside the downtown, Southwest is home to Will Rogers World Airport, which has seen increased traffic over the past several years. The airport is undergoing a nearly $90 million expansion, which is projected to increase traffic in and out of the city when completed in 2022. Close to Interstates 40 and 35, the area serves as a prime location for distribution tenants, which is why many corporations continue to choose Southwest as a landing spot.,Oklahoma City contains more than 30 million square feet of industrial inventory, and Southwest commands roughly a quarter of that space. Most of the industrial development continues to be focused here, and construction near the airport has increased. Thanks to the rise of e-commerce and increased delivery services, Amazon opened up a 2.56-million-square-foot distribution center minutes from Will Rogers Airport in 2019. The area is home to many other companies like Hobby Lobby, UPS, Walmart, and many more.,Vacancies in Oklahoma City are low, and Southwest is no different. As demand for space continues to rise, the amount of availability has fallen, especially in newly constructed properties.
