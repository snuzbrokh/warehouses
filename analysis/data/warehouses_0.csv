The western portion of this corridor was historically zoned exclusively for manufacturing, but changes in Chicago’s zoning policy opened much of this land to multifamily and office uses. The result is a mix of housing, office, and industrial uses within this diverse and dynamic area of Chicago. The eastern portion of the area boasts one of the highest population densities in the Chicago region, while the western portion includes most of the area’s manufacturing and warehouse stock. ,Manufacturers and logistics companies are drawn to this area in part due to its accessibility, with its well-connected network of interstates providing access to over 10 million people and one of the nation’s busiest ports. The area’s small and mid-sized manufacturing companies benefit from the area’s dense, infill location and span across a variety of industries, including durable and non-durable goods wholesaling, commercial printing, HVAC, plumbing, and construction, ,Millions of square feet of industrial space have been demolished in North Chicago over the past decade, as many industrial owners capitalized on quickly rising land values by selling to multifamily and office developers. The decline in available space, coupled with steady tenant demand, pushed vacancy to near historic lows. In recognition of Chicago’s growing manufacturing activity, together with the area’s appealing last-mile distribution location, North Chicago is expected to continue to attract both large and small industrial tenants.",6/6/2014,3952154,$0.58 - $1.00 SF/Mo,"Nestled on the border of Galewood and Belmont-Cragin in Northwest Side Chicago, Austin 1900 Building offers flexibility for almost any business and a location easy to reach for commuters. 5 minutes from W North Avenue, drivers can reach destinations like River North or O’Hare International Airport in around 30 minutes, traffic permitting. There is ample parking on-site for those commuting by car, but Austin 1900 Building also offers superb connectivity to public transit. The Galewood Metra Station is a 10-minute walk from the building and services the Milwaukee District West train line, which takes riders east to Union Station in around 40 minutes or as far west as Big Timber, past Elgin, in around 72. Buses on route 86 run along Narragansett Avenue and route 91 is on N Austin Avenue. The property stretches between these two major roads, making it easy to reach either. Across from the building is Amundsen Park, which has a new track and field providing recreation options to employees. Brickyard Mall is the premier retail destination in the area and only a 5-minute drive from the building. The center is home to grocery, fitness, and plenty of shopping and dining options from notable brands. Austin 1900 Building itself consists of three parcels. The first is 1900 N Austin Ave, an approximately 700,000 square foot office, research and development, and warehouse building. The second two parcels are both vacant land sites to either side of the building, approximately 6 acres to the west and 10 to the east. The offices on the south and east side offer breathtaking views of Amundsen Park and beyond to the Chicago skyline. The interior features a modern lobby, and flexibility between open offices, event spaces, space for research and development, and warehouse units with loading docks and drive-in doors.
