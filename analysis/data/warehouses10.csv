* THIS PROPERTY IS LOCATED IN AN OPPORTUNITY ZONE. – Opportunity Zones, created through the “2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” are a new community investment tool designed to spur economic development, job creation and neighborhood revitalization through private capital investment.
Under certain conditions, eligible new investments in Qualified Opportunity Funds offers three tax benefits:
1. A temporary deferral of inclusion in taxable income for capital gains reinvested into an Opportunity Fund. The deferred gain must be recognized on December 31, 2026, or the date on which the Opportunity Zone investment is disposed of, whichever is earlier.
2. A step-up in basis for capital gains reinvested in an Opportunity Fund. The basis is increased by 10% if the investment in the Opportunity Fund is held by the tax payer for at least 5 years and by an additional 5% if held for at least 7 years, thereafter excluding up to 15% of the original gain from taxation.
3. A permanent exclusion from taxable income of capital gains from the sale or exchange of an investment in an Opportunity Fund if the investment is held for at least 10 years. This exclusion only applies to gains accrued after an investment in an Opportunity Fund.

WHEN COMPARING OUR SPACE TO OTHER SPACE REMEMBER:
Many leases charge a square foot price PLUS charge the tenant for building expenses such as Taxes, Insurance & Common Area Maintenance (CAM).   Referred to as a  “Triple Net Lease” (NNN= TAXES, INSURANCE & CAM).  These expenses (often billed quarterly) are on top of your square foot monthly rent and they can fluctuate.
At BOTSIS INDUSTRIAL PARK we do NOT have triple net leases. Our tenants pay a square foot rate but are NOT charged any additional charge for TAXES, INSURANCE OR CAM.  Tenants also enjoy two other amenities: FREE WATER & SEWER.
In these uncertain times, what a relief to know you will NOT receive an unexpected bill from the landlord.  It makes it so much easier to budget from year to year.

The property is well maintained and features a spotlighted Marquee Sign at the main drive for shared tenant use. Each door at the facility is marked on the buildings exterior with a placard to assist customers, couriers or emergency personnel in locating any door easily.  

The space available is at the North end of the building, closest to Killian Rd. 
Office entrance is Door E-2, (East side, 2nd door). It is aluminum and glass w/ a blue metal awning. A Lighted Sign Box by the door is provided for Tenant's exclusive use.
