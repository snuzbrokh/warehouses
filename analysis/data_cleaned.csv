The Northern Chicago area includes some of Chicago’s most historic and desirable neighborhoods, such as Lakeview, Edgewater, Uptown and Lincoln Park. The western portion of this corridor was historically zoned exclusively for manufacturing, but changes in Chicago’s zoning policy opened much of this land to multifamily and office uses. The result is a mix of housing, office, and industrial uses within this diverse and dynamic area of Chicago. The eastern portion of the area boasts one of the highest population densities in the Chicago region, while the western portion includes most of the area’s manufacturing and warehouse stock. ,Manufacturers and logistics companies are drawn to this area in part due to its accessibility, with its well-connected network of interstates providing access to over 10 million people and one of the nation’s busiest ports. The area’s small and mid-sized manufacturing companies benefit from the area’s dense, infill location and span across a variety of industries, including durable and non-durable goods wholesaling, commercial printing, HVAC, plumbing, and construction, ,Millions of square feet of industrial space have been demolished in North Chicago over the past decade, as many industrial owners capitalized on quickly rising land values by selling to multifamily and office developers. The decline in available space, coupled with steady tenant demand, pushed vacancy to near historic lows. In recognition of Chicago’s growing manufacturing activity, together with the area’s appealing last-mile distribution location, North Chicago is expected to continue to attract both large and small industrial tenants."
